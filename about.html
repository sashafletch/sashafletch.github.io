          <h3>Origins</h3>
          <p>I’m originally from Royal Palm Beach, Florida but I now live in Oakland, California.  After completing my undergraduate degree in Psychology and Anthropology, I pursued a graduate program in Education and worked as a teacher and college counselor for several years.</p>

            <div class="column one-half">
              <p>My road to UX Design has been filled with a lot of twists and turns, but my background in psychology, anthropology, and education has informed my design experience, helping me to build creative and empathetic solutions for users. </p>
              <p>As a teacher for several years and as a graduate student, I had to create and design educational content for students. Curriculum design is an iterative and dynamic process in which teachers must account for students’ different learning styles, levels of understanding, and paces of growth. While teachers are often experienced in the field and thus understand more advanced topics, this can sometimes create a barrier to empathizing with students who have trouble grasping basic concepts. In the educational system, the focus on factual knowledge often leads teachers to mistakenly assume that their understanding of information can simply be transferred to their students. The foundation of the trajectory from novice-level to expert-level thinking is empathy; teachers need to be sensitive to the needs of their students and understand how each student learns. I consistently put myself into the shoes of my students and re-evaluated how my methods either aided their journey or exacerbated misunderstandings.
              </p>
              <p>In effect, my time as a teacher introduced me to the iterative design process; I created a systematic approach to mapping content to learning objectives. Each objective was defined by assessment strategies and content analysis that then informed my design process moving forward. It consistently demanded that I think creatively to solve problems of misunderstanding, behavior intervention, and classroom management.</p>

        <h2>The Importance of Design</h2>
        <div class="container importance_design">
          <p>I have always sought fields that focus on improving other’s lived experiences through communication and analysis. And, along with that, came a strong interest for me in understanding the influences behind individual behavior and thinking.</p>
          <p>I carry this fascination and intent into my process as a UX designer. During my mentorship program, I developed my abilities to solve real user problems by conducting thorough user research, incorporating familiar UI patterns, and consistently reiterating my designs based on user testing, feedback, and constructive criticism.</p>
