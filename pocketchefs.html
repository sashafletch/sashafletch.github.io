            <div>
              <h3>The Problem</h3>
              <p>Pocket Chefs had gone through several iterations and lacked a coherent identity when navigating through the site. Users often reported discoverability issues and new visitors were often left with uncertainty about the what the product was selling and the process of booking a chef.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>10+ user interviews had been conducted to identify key pain points with the current website. I synthesized and prioritized pain points based on the impact and feasibility of designing a solution within the limited time frame as a contract designer. I conducted A/B preference tests to bring in the voice of the end-user in determining the final redesign and guerilla testing for quick user feedback.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Design Solution</h3>
            <p>Pocket Chefs new design condensed unnecessary webpages for easier user navigation. The design focused on creating clearer calls-to-action and providing concrete information to establish trust and social proof. In order to conform to Wix's capabilities, the overall design was kept simple but was modernized for better user engagement.</p>

        </header>
        <div class="container research">
          <p>Some qualitative user research had been performed prior to my contracted position to identify key pain points. I reviewed and synthesized the results to inform my design process moving forward.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <div>
              <p>I'm a bit uncertain as to what the product really is.</p>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <div>
              <p>There's definitely a risk in having someone come to my house with my family. How do I know that this is safe?</p>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
          <br>
          <p>Overall, I identified that the redesign should prioritize the following pain points to provide a better user experience in the first stage of the redesign:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Product is unclear: cooking lessons or personalized chef?</li>
            <li>Site navigation confusing</li>
            <li>No visible pricing info</li>
            <li>Booking process unclear</li>
            <li>Unsure what resources chef needs</li>

          <p>I tried to incorporate as much user testing on my designs for Pocket Chefs despite time constraints to ensure a viable product. Through user interviews, the majority of the feedback I received concerned the copy.</p>

          <p>Picking the right hero image for the landing page was a daunting task because it required meeting the client's vision while still maintaining a strong visual layout. As such, the landing page went through several iterations. While the original landing page displayed a family eating at dinner, I decided to go a different route for several reasons. For one, <span class="bold">the original design increased visitor's cognitive load because of the varied focal points</span> displayed within the hero image. Furthermore, it distracted from any possible CTA.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In contrast to the original design, I decided to expand the image beyond the literal interpretation of the product. Part of the product's appeal is it's focus on increasing family time. I decided it would be best to <span class="bold">capture what users want to be from the product</span> rather than focusing on dinner scenes because it would <span class="bold">appeal to visitors and potential users on an emotional level</span>.</p>

            <p>The redesign process of Pocket Chefs aimed to establish an easier flow and better organize content to support conversion rates. I accomplished this with the following:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>CTAs are displayed clearly</li>
              <li>Information is more discoverable with additional spacing and better alignment</li>
              <li>Provide dedicated pages for users to get further information about pricing</li>
              <li>Provide an organized account page to manage bookings</li>
            </ul>

          <p>The major challenge with this project was the time constraints, which limited my ability to do thorough user research and testing and really engage with the results. Thankfully, some research was already available to help determine the direction of the visual design and establish the proper user stories and flows. This being the first project in which I was not involved in the research process, it was sometimes a challenge for me to interpret the results. This was compounded by the fact I was working remotely and had limited access to those that did the research component. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Overall however, this was a fun and engaging project that challenged my visual design skills and my ability to communicate my process to a non-designer. Also, for the first time, I got the opportunity to look deeply at copy and UX writing!</p>
