            <div>
              <p>While a highly valued platform amongst active and even occasional readers, Goodreads is also commonly identified as having a poor user interface, one that doesn’t cater very well to the site’s vast content. It was in dire need of an overhaul that would make it easier for users to find the information they needed quickly and be more willing to engage in the Goodreads community.</p>
              <p>Through research, I crafted a strategy to redesign the website with a focus on reorganization of information architecture, UX research and design.</p>

              <h3>The Challenge</h3>
              <p>Goodreads is a useful tool for readers that not only provides a platform to discuss and review a wide array of books but also offers several other features such as book recommendations, stats, groups, etc. With such diverse uses, the current content organization of the site is overwhelming and can unintentionally discourage users from visiting the site more often which takes away from one of the key features of Goodreads, its active community of readers and reviewers.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>The Solution</h3>
              <p>Focusing mostly on information architecture and visual design, I intended to create a site that would improve user’s ability to find relevant information, decrease cognitive load, and improve overall usage of the site.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Competitive Analysis</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="container">
            <p>Before delving into the redesign process, I took the time to see whether the current website was serving user needs by conducting several interviews, user surveys, and completing a competitive analysis.</p>
            <p>The competitive analysis was important because it helped me better understand what separated Goodreads within the market. As with any analysis, I mainly aimed to answer the following:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-listing">
              <li>How does the competition position themselves?</li>
              <li>Who is their primary audience? What user groups are they targeting?</li>
              <li>What are their key features or differentiators?</li>
              <li>What types of content is offered on this platform and how is it organized?</li>
            </ul>

              <img class="column one-third competitionIcon" src="images/goodreads/bookish.jpg" alt="Bookish Logo">

              <img class="column one-third competitionIcon" src="images/goodreads/librarything.jpg" alt="LibraryThing Logo">
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 class="bold">Changing Focus</h4>
              <p>The overall analysis revealed some of the common uses for these sites. Bookstr and Bookish, while they both had a more modern and engaging interface compared to Goodreads and LibraryThing, were based mostly on original content in the form of videos, articles, and news pieces. In looking at my redesign of Goodreads, I thus decided to focus on what sites like Bookstr were lacking and play up Goodreads’ strengths- it’s book data and social interactive components.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 class="bold">Goodreads' Reputation</h4>
              <p>Undoubtedly, the biggest competitor to Goodreads was LibraryThing. I researched public opinion of both sites, scouring discussion forums and social networking to find that LibraryThing users found Goodreads harder to navigate and weren’t as aware of the social components of Goodreads (felt that it was stronger on LibraryThing). Some positives that came out of browsing LibraryThing’s forums was discovering that many users have accounts in both and recognize the value in both. This reaffirmed for me that there was no need to change what Goodreads was offering users but it raised again the importance of how content is organized on the site and its overall user interface.</p>

        <div class="container">
          <p>To get a broader understanding of what users want and expect in book sites like those featured in my competitive analysis, I completed a survey that was sent through various social media platforms. About one third of survey participants were Goodreads members. My main findings were as follows:</p>
          <div class="mobile_graphs clearfix">
            <div>
              <h4 class="bold">How Active Are You on Goodreads?</h4>

              <canvas id="graph2"></canvas>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Of the participants that were Goodreads users, <span class="bold">most did not visit the site very often (62% only visited the site a couple times a year)</span> and the most common reason was to <span class="bold">browse for books, view recommended books, or to look up a book’s rating</span>. What could potentially incentivize users to visit the site more often? Overall, users value the ratings and reviews on Goodreads, commenting: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <div class="vertical">
              <p>“They seem to be <span class="bold">more accurate</span> compared to other sites.”</p>

          <blockquote>
            <div class="vertical">
              <p>“Yes, since Goodreads isn't a bookseller and all kinds of people from all over use it, I think the <span class="bold">ratings are less controlled</span>.”</p>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <div class="vertical">
              <p>“I think Goodreads ratings are <span class="bold">only helpful when it is paired with a massive review set</span>. Otherwise, they can be very telling of a specific audience base, only.”</p>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <div class="vertical">
              <p>“Although opinions differ, if there are enough good ratings they can't be wrong!”</p>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Concerning reviews:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <div class="vertical">
              <p>“The reviews are helpful because they tend to be <span class="bold">more insightful</span>.”</p>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <div class="vertical">
              <p>“I absolutely think <span class="bold">they are helpful!</span> Maybe not in itself, but it is telling of the kind of audience the book attracts.”</p>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <div class="vertical">
              <p>“The <span class="bold">vast amount of reviews is really relevant</span> as then I can gauge how legitimate the reviews really are. Goodreads usually has a fairly good number of reviews.”</p>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Not many survey participants indicated that they take part in book discussions online, but many, even non-members, indicated that they would use Goodreads to discover new books. This corroborated my findings from the SWOT analysis concerning the main difference between Goodreads and LibraryThing. It seems that discussions and social interactions on the site are not participated in enough and this could partially be a result of the cluttered interface.</p>
          <p>It should also be noted that both groups (Goodreads members and non-members) heavily valued both ratings and reviews. I discovered the same through more in-depth interviews.</p>

            <p>I delve into sketches and wireframes to provide clarity into how information will be organized on the screen. The absence of finishing details allows me to focus on content organization and begin the testing process for faster reiteration.</p>
            <p>For Goodreads, I developed basic sketches of the main screens and corresponding wireframes:</p>
            <div>
              <h4>Home Page</h4>
              <p>Overall, the original home page has limited balance with the right side of advertisements overpowering the design and limited negative space. Negative space in content-heavy sites is more important than the positive.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <img src="images/goodreads/Original Home.jpg" alt="Home Page Original">
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="container">
              <p>The wireframe goes with a two-column layout to provide more spacing between elements. More negative space gives greater clarity to content and decreases users' cognitive processing of information.</p>

              <p>This page features a lot of different book details and information. Sections are not evenly aligned, requiring more effort of the user. There is little rhythm of elements, limiting comprehension and ease of use.</p>

            <p>Based on preference test results, I developed high-fidelity mockups from the chosen wireframes in preparation for usability testing. Via Maze, participants were asked to complete basic tasks and provide feedback.</p>

            <blockquote>

                <p>“Some of the grey tool bars were very similar to the bottom of the page so when I scrolled to it I thought it was the bottom of the page. So that was confusing.”</p>

            <p>In response to the feedback from the usability testing, I decided to make the footer an off-black to ground the interface and distinguish the secondary navigation bar. Thankfully, “groups” already exists on the current Goodreads platform under the 'Community' tab but the option was not made available to users during the testing phase.</p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>In approaching the redesign process for Goodreads, I decided to focus on the most basic user actions- ones that were most prevalent amongst my survey participants and interviewees. This allowed me to really focus on how I approach content organization and my UI skills. Even in looking at just the basic actions a user could take on the site, I found it challenging to balance all the information present on the site and find innovative ways to incorporate them in a more simplistic design. However, in completing the project, I became encouraged to approach more complex issues on the Goodreads site, such as categorizing review formats (gifs, pictures, text) in a way that could be more useful for browsers. Overall, I enjoyed the opportunity to approach a skill I needed to develop further and anticipate delving further into a redesign of Goodreads on all fronts.</p>
