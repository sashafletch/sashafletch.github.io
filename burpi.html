            <h2>BURPI</h2>
            <div>
              <p>Health and fitness apps have been on a steady rise, increasing access and allowing users from different backgrounds to focus on their overall health and wellness through tracking, coaching, and lifestyle advising. These apps also provide a level of serviceability that accommodates to different goals and individual concerns. Burpi’s goal is to ensure a level of individual customization that the average user does not have access to with a simple gym membership. It is an affordable and accessible personal trainer for every user.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row overview">
            <div class="column left-column one-half">
              <h3>The Challenge</h3>
              <p>Physical gyms and fitness programs like Weightwatchers provide individuals with a community of people with similar goals. Mayo Clinic identifies the existence of community for support as the difference between success and failure for weight-loss and fitness goals. A community can provide inspirational, emotional, or practical support. Unfortunately, there has been a negative correlation with customizability and community. The more options users are given to individualize their fitness app, the less focus there is on providing community.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column right-column one-half">
              <h3>The Solution</h3>
              <p>Burpi recognizes that both ends of the spectrum (customizability and community) are important for overall success in any health or fitness plan. It is a social fitness app that provides users with the ability to connect to others who have similar goals and share their progress. With a social feed like Facebook and Instagram, it provides a level of sociability lacking on other fitness platforms. This support network not only increases the likelihood of success for users, but it also recognizes that connections between users increases their usage of the app.</p>

ActiveX provided users with the ability to join packs as part of their platform, but users did not have the ability to choose members within the pack.</p>

      <section>
        <div class="container">
          <h3>Early Insights</h3>
          <p>To understand what users expect and desire from their fitness application, I conducted a survey that was posted through various online platforms, including social media and fitness forums. By doing so, I received responses from a variety of sources: individuals with a fitness background and those with little experience. However, more than 50% of applicants had used or currently use some sort of fitness application.</p>
          <div class="mobile_graphs clearfix">
            <p>The biggest challenge participants commonly identified regarding achieving their fitness goals is losing motivation and lacking accountability. This is partially a result of the individualistic nature of most fitness applications- the lack of community and support means there is no accountability which can then cause individuals to lose motivation.</p>
            <div>
              <h4>Whose Support Keeps You Motivated?</h4>
              <div id="js-legend" class="chart-legend"></div>
              <canvas id="graph1"></canvas>
            </div>
            <p>While many may assume those with fitness goals would like the support of their family or a personal trainer, most participants (47%) in the survey surprisingly indicated that they would rather receive support from someone with similar fitness goals.</p>
            <p>It is important to also note however, that while participants indicated they craved a sense of community, they also overwhelmingly preferred to work out alone.</p>

          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>Two sets of usabilty tests were conducted, one with high-fidelity wireframes and the other with high-fidelity mockups. In my first series of user tests, I created a maze to determine the app’s ease-of-use and to quickly identify any problems in the information architecture early on. Users were asked to perform four tasks in both sets of tests:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sign up for an account</li>
            <li>Log an activity</li>
            <li>Create a daily reminder</li>
            <li>View a friend's profile</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="onboarding-test">
            <h4>Onboarding</h4>
              <p>Participants indicated that they would prefer to see a sample of their customized fitness plan before committing to creating an account.</p>

          <div class="navigation-test">
            <h4>Navigation</h4>
              <p>When asked to log an activity, many users were unable to determine the meaning of the bottom navigation's 'plus sign', which would complete the task. The icon also enforced too many clicks to navigate to the wanted page so the bottom navigation was reconfigured for direct clicks.</p>

              <p class="bold_italic center">"Activities" vs. "Workouts"</p>
              <p>In a second round of user testing, it became clear there was confusion distinguishing "activity" and "workout". The former was intended to categorize any activity that was not a planned workout (i.e., playing sports, walking, running). Based on user feedback, the distinction was removed and the new design allows users to select basic activities and workouts from the same screen.</p>

              <p class="bold_italic center selectionBar">"Change" vs. "Replace"</p>
              <p>Burpi provides users with the freedom to change the day's planned workout and also the ability to edit a given workout. User testing results showed that the "Change" selection under the day's workout was causing confusion with these two distinct options. Intended for users to switch the workout to a different activity, I determined that "replace" would better inform users which action the demand coincided.</p>

            <div class="dailyReminder">
              <h4>Daily Reminders</h4>
              <p>This task had over half of participants successfully navigate to the settings page in both sets of usability tests. Of those that did not complete the task successfully, they incorrectly navigated to the day’s planned workout. To accommodate these users, I decided to add a notification icon to the workout page that connects directly to the proper settings page for daily reminders.</p>

          <div class="preference-tests">
            <p>In determining the brand for Burpi, I developed moodboards, word-maps, and considered trends among other fitness apps. The following images were a few of the sketches developed in brainstorming the proper font-style that properly represented the style and personality of the app:</p>

            </div>
            <p>Based on feedback, two of the sketches were converted into vector images with edits:</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>A preference test was developed to determine the logo that best represented the social fitness app.</p>
            <p>The first logo was described as being more iconic and having more visual emotion than the second. Participants also mentioned that it was more legible and energetic.</p>
            <p>In helping to make a final decision on the logo, I also developed several mood boards that explored different color palettes and themes: </p>

            <p>Creating this fitness app was a very exciting process. I think the most important lesson I learned was that even well-recognized and universal designs have their problems. From the placement of reminders to the use of plus icons, the translation to Burpi was not always seamless. This once again raised the importance of testing for me. One of the main faults of my initial research phase was that I did not get an opportunity to interview individuals unaccustomed to fitness apps for my personas, though they participated in the survey. This created a gap for me in building an app that would be accessible to both experienced and inexperienced users. As such, more issues came up during usability testing; I had participants who completed tasks effortlessly while others were very confused by terminology and the organization of information. But despite these issues, creating Burpi further developed my understanding of contemporary design trends and how to critically analyze research and testing results to create reasonable solutions.
